Source code can be open by avr studio 7.

I provide two hex code ready to use. One is 10 seconds gate for testing. And the other is 1000 and 10000 seconds final version.

If you want to change the second gate in source code. It's line 183, 185 and 196, 198. Time gate is in hexadecimal.

This code is based on my gpsdo. It's the same code except here, the pwm and other features are disabled. I only kept the counter part. This whole project is available here:
